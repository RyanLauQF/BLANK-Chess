# Chess-Engine

A Chess engine in the making.

This engine is based off Object-Oriented design using Java.

Main movement logic for generating all legal moves have been implemented, including promotion to all types.

_Chess is playable with a User Interface by running ChessGUI._

## Main logic TODO List:
1) Implement 50 move rule, and repetition for AI

**After building a working chess game, build board evaluation methods to make a working engine**

## Engine TODO List:
1) Implement player class to set players / AIs to play the game
2) Implement Negamax Algorithm to evaluate moves
3) Implement alpha-beta Pruning
