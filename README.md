# Chess-Engine

A Chess engine in the making.

Main move generator has been implemented for all pieces with the exception of Pawn Promotion.

_Chess is now playable within CLI in main method of Board class with the exception of Promotion logic yet to be implemented._

## Main logic TODO List:
1) Implement Promotion 
2) Implement turn data on board (At this point, chess should be a playable according to all rules)
3) Implement a simple Chess GUI


**After building a working chess game, build board evaluation methods to make a working engine**
