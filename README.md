# Chess-Engine

A Chess engine in the making.

This engine is based off Object-Oriented design using Java.

Main move generator has been implemented for all pieces and pawn to queen is available.

_Chess is now playable with a User Interface in ChessGUI. Only queen promotion for pawns is currently available._

## Main logic TODO List:
1) Complete pawn Promotion implementation for promotion to Knight / Bishop / Rook.
2) Implement turn data on board

**After building a working chess game, build board evaluation methods to make a working engine**

## Engine TODO List:
1) Implement player class to set players / AIs to play the game
2) Implement Negamax Algorithm to evaluate moves
3) Implement alpha-beta Pruning
