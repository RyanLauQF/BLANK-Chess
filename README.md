# Chess-Engine

A Chess engine in the making.

Main move generator has been implemented for all pieces with the exception of Castling, Enpassant and Promotion.

## Main logic TODO List:
1) Implement logic for Castling, Enpassant and Promotion 
2) Implement turn data counter and move logic on board (At this point, chess should be a playable according to all rules)
3) Implement a simple Chess GUI


**After building a working chess game, build board evaluation methods to make a working engine**
