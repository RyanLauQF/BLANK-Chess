# Chess-Engine

A Chess engine in the making.

Main move generator has been implemented for all pieces with the exception of Pawn Promotion.

This engine is based off Object-Oriented design using Java.

_Chess is now playable with a User Interface in ChessGUI with the exception of Promotion logic yet to be implemented._

## Main logic TODO List:
1) Implement Promotion 
2) Implement turn data on board (At this point, chess should be a playable according to all rules)

### GUI TODO List:
1) Highlighting of legal moves and selection of piece to move


**After building a working chess game, build board evaluation methods to make a working engine**
